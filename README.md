## Features

Document Retrieval: Fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base.

Text Generation: Uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate answers based on retrieved documents.

Indexing: Supports vector and keyword-based indexing for efficient search.

API Integration: Exposes endpoints for seamless integration with other applications.

Configurable Pipeline: Allows customization of retrieval and generation parameters.
