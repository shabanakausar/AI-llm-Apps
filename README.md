## Overview

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a hybrid approach that enhances the performance of language models by retrieving relevant external documents before generating responses. This application implements a RAG pipeline to improve answer accuracy and contextual understanding.

## Features

* Document Retrieval: Fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base.

* Text Generation: Uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate answers based on retrieved documents.

* Indexing: Supports vector and keyword-based indexing for efficient search.

* API Integration: Exposes endpoints for seamless integration with other applications.

* Configurable Pipeline: Allows customization of retrieval and generation parameters.
